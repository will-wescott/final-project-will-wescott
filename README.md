My ultimate goals for this project were to create an easy to use workout builder. I wanted this to have every type of workout and fit everyones needs rather than being for a specific group. I love going to the gym and lifing weights and that is what originally inspired me to create this project. In this code I used and completed lists, if-else, switch, at least 2 methods, 2 more methods, foreach, reading from a file, string formatting, input from a user. Completing this project helped me further understand c# programming fundamentals. Along with that it taught me how to problem solve and think about the scalability of my project as a whole.
